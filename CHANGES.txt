Changelog
=========

0.5 (unreleased)
----------------

* Update tests.


0.4 (2010-03-06)
----------------

* Cleaned the tests module. Now, we only use the ZTK packages to test.

* The dependencies have been cleared. We no longer depend on zope.app
  packages.

* Updated the security grokking in the menu items grokker. We don't
  need the protect_getattr, as the view security grokker already does
  it for us.

* Fixed the dependencies in the package requires. All dependencies are
  now clearly declared.

* Added a LICENSE.txt file for the ZPL 2.1.


0.3 (2009-11-02)
----------------

* Added the support of the grokcore.viewlet 'order' directive to
  reorder the menu items and sub menus. This permits to have a
  baseclass defining the basic menu and to keep the ordering
  possibility in the sublasses. We probably should do that for the
  different arguments of the menuitem directive. That would allow more
  genericity and reusability. Note : this change is 100% backward
  compatible. Simply added tests to show the behavior. [trollfot]

* Get rid of the grok dependency. Now depends only on grokcore.* packages

* Updated the build process
